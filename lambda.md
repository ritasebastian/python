A **lambda** in Python is a way to create small, anonymous functions (functions without a name). It's often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time.

Here’s a breakdown for beginners:

### What Does a Lambda Look Like?
A lambda function is defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by:
1. **Input arguments** (like parameters in a regular function).
2. A **colon** `:` symbol.
3. An **expression** (the result of which will be returned).

### Basic Syntax:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

### Example:
Let’s create a lambda function that adds 10 to a number:
```python
add_10 = lambda x: x + 10
print(add_10(5))  # Output: 15
```

### How is it Different from a Regular Function?
A regular function looks like this:
```python
def add_10(x):
    return x + 10
```
The lambda equivalent is shorter and does not need a name:
```python
lambda x: x + 10
```

### When to Use Lambda?
- When you need a quick, throwaway function.
- Often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

### Examples with Built-in Functions:

1. **Using `map()`**:
   Multiply every number in a list by 2.
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   doubled = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
   print(list(doubled))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
   ```

2. **Using `filter()`**:
   Find even numbers in a list.
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
   print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]
   ```

3. **Using `sorted()`**:
   Sort a list of tuples by the second element.
   ```python
   pairs = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 4)]
   sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: x[1])
   print(sorted_pairs)  # Output: [(3, 1), (1, 2), (5, 4)]
   ```

### Things to Remember:
- Lambda functions are meant for simple operations.
- They can have **any number of arguments** but only **one expression**.
- Lambda functions are less readable than regular functions if overused.
