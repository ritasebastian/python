Function and variable annotations in Python are a way to provide additional information about the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. These annotations do not affect the execution of the code; they are mainly for documentation and readability purposes. 

Here's a beginner-friendly explanation with examples:

---

### **Function Annotations**
Function annotations are used to specify the expected types of parameters and the return type of a function. They are written after the parameter name, separated by a colon, and the return type is specified using the `->` operator.

**Example:**

```python
# Function with annotations
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# Calling the function
message = greet("Alice", 25)
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.
```

- `name: str` indicates that the `name` parameter should be a string.
- `age: int` indicates that the `age` parameter should be an integer.
- `-> str` specifies that the function returns a string.

### **Variable Annotations**
Variable annotations are used to specify the expected type of a variable. They can be added using a colon followed by the type.

**Example:**

```python
# Variable annotations
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 25
height: float = 5.6

# Printing the variables
print(name)   # Output: Alice
print(age)    # Output: 25
print(height) # Output: 5.6
```

### **Combining Function and Variable Annotations**
Hereâ€™s an example combining both:

```python
# Function with annotations
def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float:
    pi: float = 3.14159  # Variable annotation
    return pi * radius * radius

# Calling the function
area = calculate_area(5.0)
print(f"The area is {area}")  # Output: The area is 78.53975
```

### **Key Points**
1. **Annotations are optional:** They do not enforce type checking during runtime. Tools like linters or type checkers (e.g., `mypy`) can use them for static type checking.
2. **Use for documentation:** They help others (and yourself) understand your code better.

### **Best Practices**
- Use annotations to make your code self-documenting.
- Pair annotations with meaningful variable and function names for clarity.
- Use tools like `mypy` to check types during development.
